Here I try to simulate the rod-shaped version of the model in folder v2:

-> rods_twitching.cc - code containing the simulation with nematic alignment
-> rods_twitching_torque.cc - version of the code with torque
-> runs_params.sh - to run the simulations; modify parameters as needed
-> rods_tw_analysis.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with the data analysis 
-> params.dat - store parameter values 

particle_positions_... files columns: x y theta_b theta_p
Theta_b = main axis angle
theta_p = pili angle
(x,y) = bacteria position

In wrong_RNG:

-> double_forcing (two kinds of repulsion)
-> wrong_IC : overlapping initial conditions
-> no_overlap_correction : allows for overlapping (not ideal)

Nematic : with nematic alignment instead or torque (corresponds to rods_twitching.cc)

diff_rate_def : refers to a different definition in the condition with the moving rate
if (rate*Dt) ...
This means the rate had to be changed along with Dt, which does not mean that it'a wrong, just that it's not ideal 
But still with torque

restrictive_angle: 
Version of the model with absolute pili angle (wrong)
